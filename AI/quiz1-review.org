Lets walk through the uninformed search example question(s)
#+end_quote
Consider the above map of cities with edges between cities showing the costs of
traveling between city pairs
* Q1
Show how the uniform-cost search would progress with this map of cities. Start
city is A and the goal city is G.
* Q2
Repeat the search process as in question 1, but handle duplicate states
* Q3
Repeat the search process using BFS
* Q4
Repeat the search process using DFS
* Q5
Intuitively find the least cost from A to G
