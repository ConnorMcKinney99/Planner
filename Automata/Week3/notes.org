* Determinisitic finite acceptor(DFA)
+ M = \((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)
+ Q is a finite set of internal states
+ \(\Sigma\): Input alphabet
+ \(\delta\): \(Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q\) is a total function (transition function)
+ \(q_0 \in Q\) is the initial/start state
+ \(F \subseteq Q\) is the set of final states
** Example
+ Starts in \(q_0\), reading head is leftmost character in string
+ each time slot the state is computed from the \(\delta\) function based on the
  current state and the character in the reading head. The reading head moves to
  the next character after each time slot
+ Once the last character is read, the state is either accepted or rejected
  based on whether the state is in \(F\)
** Extended transition function
+ \(\delta^* : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q\)
+ one shot identification of state change for any string
