* Chapter 1
** Terms
+ =Hosts=: end systems that run apps
+ =Apps=
+ =Devices=: run apps
+ =Packet switches= (chucks of data)
+ =Communication links=: transmission forms like fiber, radio, etc
+ =Access Network=: A network that bottlenecks to one router (edge router) to get
  back to isp
+ =Edge Router=: A router on the "edge" of a network
+ Protocols: Control sending, receiving.
+ Internet Standards
+ TCP connection
+ RFC: Request for comments
+ IETF: Internet Enginering Task Force
+ AP: wireless access point
+ NAT: firewall, router
** Nuts and bolts
+ Hosts run apps
+ Devices at the core of the network (routers, switches)
+ Router decides what to do with chunk of data
+ TCP, HTTP are protocols
+ RFC:
** Access networks
+ Digital subscriber line (DSL)
+ cable-based access
  + HFC hybrid fiber coax
    + fiber optics connect neighborhood junctions
    + coaxial cable connects homes to neighborhood junctions
    + cable modem has higher downstream than upstream
  + Network of cables,fiber optics connect to ISP router
+ Fiber to the homer (FTTH)
  + fiber leaving CO is shared
  + splitter (100 homes)
  + Gbps range
  + Optical Network Terminator (ONT) is an analog for modems
  + Optical
*** 5g fixed wireless
Data is sent wirelessy to modem in home
** Wireless access networks
+ Wireless local area networks (wlans)
** Wide-area cellular access networks
+ 4g/5g cellular networks
** enterprise networks
+ switches connect to modem which goes to isp
** Packets of data
+ length L bits
+ tranmission rate (packets per time) R
+ link capacity = link bandwitch = capacity
+ transmission delay
** links
+ bit: tranmitter/reciever pairs
+ physical link: what lies between tranmitter and reciever
+ guided media (cables, fiber, etc)
+ unguided media (wireless)
+ TP (twisted pair) cables (cat6): 10gbs
