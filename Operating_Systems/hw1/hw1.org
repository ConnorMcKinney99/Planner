* Task 1
I followed the steps given in the assignment: I downloaded the ubuntu image from
the website, loaded it into the virtual machine, and installed ubuntu. I used
all the recommended specs given in the assignment. Additionally, I installed the
virtualbox guest tools so I could fullscreen the vm. I have done this before, so
did not run into many difficulties. The only minor difficulty was in getting
virtualbox installed in my system (NixOS), but that was easily solved by
following the directions on the NixOS wiki for virtualbox.
